        Register a function (and optional argument) to be called if and

        The function must be written as if it were an asynchonrous POSIX
        signal handler -- use only async-safe functions, and remember
        that it is executed from another thread.
        A typical function might set a flag or write to a pipe so that
        the rest of the application knows that the JACK client thread
        has shut down.

        .. note:: Clients do not need to call this.  It exists only to

            .. note:: The *callback* should typically signal another
               thread to correctly finish cleanup by calling `close()`
               (since it cannot be called directly in the context of the
               thread that calls the shutdown callback).

               After server shutdown, the client is *not* deallocated by
               JACK, the user (that's you!) is responsible to properly
               use `close()` to release client ressources.
               Alternatively, the `Client` object can be used as a
               *context manager* in a *with statement*, which takes care
               of activating, deactivating and closing the client
               automatically.

           might become active at an inconvenient time and block the
           process callback for some time.

           Because of this, Python is not really suitable for real-time
           processing.  If you want to implement a *reliable* real-time
           audio/MIDI application, you should use a different
           programming language, such as C or C++.

           If you can live with some random audio drop-outs now and

              is now a moving target.

                callback(state: int, blocksize: int, pos: jack_position_t, new_pos: bool) -> None

            state
                The current transport state.  See `transport_state`.
            blocksize
                The number of frames in the current period.
                See `blocksize`.
            pos
                The position structure for the next cycle; ``pos.frame``
                will be its frame number.  If *new_pos* is ``False``,
                this structure contains extended position information
                from the current cycle.  If *new_pos* is ``True``, it
                contains whatever was set by the requester.
                The *callback*'s task is to update the extended
                information here.  See `transport_query_struct()`
                for details about ``jack_position_t``.
            new_pos
                ``True`` for a newly requested *pos*, or for the first
                cycle after the timebase callback is defined.

            .. note:: The *pos* argument must not be used to set
               ``pos.frame``.  To change position, use

               These functions are realtime-safe, the timebase callback
               can call them directly.
        conditional : bool

        Returns
        -------
        bool

        is_terminal : bool

        A ringbuffer is a good way to pass data between threads
        (e.g. between the main program and the process callback),
        when streaming realtime data to slower media, like audio file
        playback or recording.

        The key attribute of a ringbuffer is that it can be safely
        accessed by two threads simultaneously -- one reading from the
        buffer and the other writing to it -- without using any
        synchronization or mutual exclusion primitives.  For this to
        work correctly, there can only be a single reader and a single
        writer thread.  Their identities cannot be interchanged.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int
            Size in bytes.  JACK will allocate a buffer of at least this
            size (rounded up to the next power of 2), but one byte is
